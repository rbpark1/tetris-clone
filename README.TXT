This is a Tetris clone built with Java. It uses the Greenfoot development environment and was made as a final project for my high school CS class.
To start this project, download and install Greenfoot from http://www.greenfoot.org/download. Run the file called "Final Tetris with Recusion&Iterators& Comments.gfar"
To start the game, press "Run". Control falling pieces with the arrow keys.
